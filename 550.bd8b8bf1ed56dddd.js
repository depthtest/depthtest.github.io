A family of these related artefacts, alignments, multi- and anti-alignments are defined over a distance function between observed behaviour and model replay, both represented as words from a given alphabet. Encoding this distance function, commonly the Levenshtein distance, into MaxSAT enables us to take advantage of state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers. In this paper we provide an improvement upon previous SAT encodings for the alignment artefact family. We achieve a reduction in the resulting formula size while also obtaining good performance results on the computation of the artefacts.
