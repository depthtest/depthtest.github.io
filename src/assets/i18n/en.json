        "PARAGRAPH1_TAG": "Nowadays I am a Researcher at University of Lleida (UdL), working on constraint programming and machine learning algorithms and their applications, while lecturing on Security, Web, Computing and Artificial Intelligence. Previous experiences have included lecturing on Physics and Computer Graphics at the School of New Interactive Technologies - University of Barcelona (ENTI-UB) and working on medical imaging in real-time applications at Galgo Medical and video-analysis software for football (soccer) training at Mediapro, both as a senior software engineer and research engineer.",
        "PARAGRAPH2_TAG": "Previously I received the Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and the Master’s Degree on Open Source from the University of Lleida in 2006 and 2008, respectively. Then I earned my PhD in Computing at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) in May 2013, while at the MOVING and ViRVIG research groups. I focused on the simulation and visualization of fluids in real-time, using the Lattice Boltzmann Method in CUDA and OpenGL with full real-time visual effects.",
        "PARAGRAPH3_TAG": "My knowledge is not restricted just to my research, as I am always looking for more, and surely you will find me reading new articles and books on whatever new technologies arise as my research interests range from physically-based animation and rendering to GPU programming, machine learning, artificial intelligence and optimization."
