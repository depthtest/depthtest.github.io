abstract="We present OptiLog, a new Python framework for rapid prototyping of SAT-based systems. OptiLog allows to use and integrate SAT solvers currently developed in C/C++ just by implementing the iSAT C++ interface. It also provides a Python binding to the PBLib C++ toolkit for encoding Pseudo Boolean and Cardinality constraints. Finally, it leverages thepower of automatic configurators by allowing to easily create configuration scenarios including multiple solvers and encoders.",
